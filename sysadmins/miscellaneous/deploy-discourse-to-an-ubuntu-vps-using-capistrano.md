title: Deploy Discourse to an Ubuntu VPS using Capistrano
---

UPDATE: I strongly suggest you use the [Docker-based installation](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-digital-ocean.md) that is more officially supported. If you reaaaaaally want to do this instead, then read on.

I read through @baus's [thread](http://meta.discourse.org/t/installing-discourse-on-ubuntu-12-10-and-digital-ocean/3395) for throwing Discourse onto an Ubuntu server, but I really wanted to deploy it the same way I deploy all of my own apps: with Capistrano.

So I've written up this blog post to help others who want to follow the same path. I hope it helps you guys! This post should help new Discourse users hit the ground running on an Ubuntu 12 or 13 VPS with **zero-downtime deployments** using Capistrano.

If you guys have any issues, please let me know here and I'll edit the guide ASAP. Thanks!
