I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to set up the mailbox in google apps to work with Discourse so that there is a user-friendly incoming email address for each category. Here are some screenshots that show how I did it. Tested and it seems to be working well. 

In summary: assuming the domain name is foo.com, there's an email mailbox discourse@foo.com for handling all discourse-bound mail, using discourse+replykey@foo.com to handle matching replies to topics and aliases for the mailbox to handle incoming mail for eg categoryname matched with nice email address categoryname@foo.com.
