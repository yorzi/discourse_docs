In this guide we'll be creating a new badge "Scholar" that we will grant to individual users manually. Let's get started!

## Create a new custom badge

Create a new custom badge from Admin > Badges page by clicking on "New" button.

## Fill out badge details

Fill out the badge details. In our example, I am naming the badge "Scholar" and badge type "Gold".

Note that badge image can either be a [font awesome icon](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) or an image URL. In this example I chose the font awesome icon "fa-graduation-cap".
