title: Configure your domain name for hosted Discourse
---

So you've selected a hosted Discourse plan. Lucky you!

The very first step is to point your domain name `forum.example.com` to our hosting.

- You will need to edit the DNS records for your domain name, `example.com`.

- In most cases, the DNS is controlled from the same place where you originally purchased the `example.com` domain from.

- Log into your name registrar and find your DNS control panel.

-  In the DNS control panel, CNAME `forum` to point at `hosted-vh1.discourse.org`. If you will be adding SSL to enable https support, point the CNAME to `hosted-vh2.discourse.org`.

- Wait for the change to propagate and we'll take care of the rest.

This page provides a list of detailed instructions for many of the major Domain Name providers. Select your provider from the list below to get detailed instructions for how to CNAME your domain.

If you cannot find your provider or are still having trouble configuring your CNAME records, contact us at `team@discourse.org`.
