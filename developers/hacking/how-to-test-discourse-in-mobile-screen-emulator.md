After some trial and error, I came to the conclusion that the built-in [Mobile Emulation][1] in Chrome is the best way to quickly preview Discourse pages on a mobile device.

Sure you can also just append `?mobile_view=1` to an URL, but the emulator has the added benefit of letting you select the screen profile of a specific device.

I also tested all of the most popular online screen emulators, but unfortunately Discourse doesn't work on any of these. I assume they're not made to handle JavaScript-heavy apps.

Edit: I asked Screenfly why Discourse wasn't working, this is their reply:

> Screenfly doesn't work on every website.  Most commonly, this is a security setting on the web server that disallows display inside of frames (like those used in Screenfly).
