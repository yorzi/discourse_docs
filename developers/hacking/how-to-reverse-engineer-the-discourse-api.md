title: How to reverse engineer the Discourse API

Discourse is backed by a complete JSON api. Anything you can do on the site you can also do using the JSON api. 

Many of the endpoints are properly documented in the [discourse_api][1] gem, however some endpoints lack documentation. 

To determine how to do something with the JSON API here are some steps you can follow. 

Example: recategorize a topic.

- Go to a topic and start editing a category:

- Open Chrome dev tools, select XHR filter:

- Perform the operation

- Look at preview as well to figure out the results

- You now have all the info you need. 

 1. The endpoint is `http://try.discourse.org/t/online-learning/108.json`

 2. Payload is passed using a `PUT`

 3. The params sent are: 
   `title: Online learning` 
   `category_id: 5`

Equip with this information you can make your own calls using your favorite programming language, all you need to do is add **api_username** and **api_key** to parameters to the request. 

They can be generated using the API admin tab.
