Is it possible to create/delete groups via the API? I could only find how to assign a user to a group but not how to create them. In the end I would like to sync the Discourse groups with my BuddyPress groups as I want to replace bbPress but I like the actual integration it has with BuddyPress ☺ unfortunately the php api is a bit behind so it looks like a rocky way to get there :( Maybe I am not alone with this idea and we can work together on this as my budget is not that great and I want to keep it open source of possible ☺
