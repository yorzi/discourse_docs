**To set the last seen date for users who have never logged in (never seen):**
```
User.where("last_seen_at IS NULL").update_all(last_seen_at: 1.week.ago)
```

**To default all users to mailing list mode (send an email for every new post):**
```
User.update_all(mailing_list_mode: true)
```

**To default all users to email always mode (do not suppress email notifications when user is active on the site):**
```
User.update_all(email_always: true)
```
