title: What are Mentions?
---

If you want to get a specific user's attention, the best way to do that is usually with a "mention", a concept popularised by social media sites like Twitter.

To mention a user in Discourse, you start by typing the `@` character immediately followed by the first letters of that someone's username. If you're posting in an existing topic, Discourse will intelligently push active topic participants to the top of the auto-completion list.

Typing a part of a user's full name will also work.
