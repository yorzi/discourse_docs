title: How does title and favicon notification work?
---

Out-of-the-box Discourse enables "title" notifications, this feature will "re-write" the browser title to denote how many new items your current page has. 

User may opt to receive "favicon" notifications by selecting  `Show new / updated topic count on browser icon` in user profile, when this is selected the notifications will be super-imposed on the browser icon. 

This feature operates in **2 modes**:

### First mode is if you are watching **topic list**.

Or in the icon mode:

> :alarm_clock: in topic list you should expect that the count in the blue box will **always** match the count in the title or icon. 

### Second mode is for watching a topic

By placing your tab on a topic page and then kicking tab to the **background**, we will start counting all **new** posts in the topic.

> :alarm_clock: As soon as topic gains focus the count will go down to 0

### Feature use cases:

- Quickly tell if someone posted something new on a particular topic.
- Quickly tell if you have new or unread posts on a category.
- Quickly tell if there has been any new activity in the site since you last looked. 
- Unlike unread notifications this feature can be tapped by anonymous users and allows very high fidelity of notifications.
