A wiki post is a special type of post that can be edited by any user on your forum.

To [mark a post as wiki-editable][1], you need moderator/admin privileges. (or TL4?)

## Properties of Wiki Posts

- Post will be highlighted (default is green)
- Takes advantage of Discourse's built in revisions.
- By default, posts can be edited by any user with TL1 or above.
 - To change the trust level required to edit wiki posts, adjust the *min trust to edit wiki post* admin setting
- If two users are editing the post at the same time, the latest save becomes the latest revision, thus overwriting the contents of the previous save.

## Currently NOT supported in Wiki Posts

- (Automatic) Table of Contents
- Edit lock / Simultaneous editing
- Footnotes
